# Mula - Micro Savings App
This app utilizes the PayPal API to allow for micro saving - by rounding every transaction up to the nearest dollar and saving the difference. The user is not allowed access to these funds until a certain saved amount is reached. But, once this amount is reached, the user can utilize these funds for various purposes.

## Usage
- Prepare your environment by executing the requirements.txt file, e.g. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the web app as `python app.py`
